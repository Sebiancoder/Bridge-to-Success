# Bridge-to-Success
A Chemistry Review game made for a Honors Chemistry project. The objective of the game is to try to cross a river of lava by answering chemistry questions.

There are two players, red and blue. They have to race against each other to make it to the other side of a river of lava by hopping across rocks. The catch is that each player must make it to the corner diagonally opposite from its starting point. Addtionally, the players cannot recross their own path or cross the path of the other player. This means that as one player progresses further and further toward his corner, it becomes harder and harder for the other player to make it to his corner.

If a question is answered incorrectly, the rock that the player was trying to move to is destroyed and cannot be used by either player.

A complete list of the questions in this game can be found in JSON format in the file entitled "questions.json", which is located in the resources folder.

The JAR file can be found in the folder out/artifacts/Bridge_to_Success_jar.
